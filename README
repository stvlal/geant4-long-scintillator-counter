Before run the programm don't forget to source ../path/to/geant4-install/bin/geant4.sh and ../path/to/geant4-install/share/Geant4-xxx/geant4make/geant4make.sh

Usage:

mkdir build

cd build/

cmake ..

make

./tof_Detector run.mac light_guide.stl, or
./tof_Detector light_guide.stl


Editing *.mac files only in the 'tof_detector' directory (not in the 'build'). After any editing *.mac files you should execute 'cmake ..' in the 'build' directory. cmake copies all *.mac files into 'build' folder from 'tof_detector' directory.
